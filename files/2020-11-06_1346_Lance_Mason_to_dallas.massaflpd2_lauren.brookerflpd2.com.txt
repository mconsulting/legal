Hello

I'm a client as it were and have a court date at 8:30 on Monday. This is a railroad job and I'll explain as 
much about the larger civil case from which this case arises.

I'm not sure if you got the discovery back but if it's missing the incident itself it might raise some 
questions. 

Listen to this recorded phone conversation with the third guy from the FSU PD. It's as if he was going 
down a list for reasons to trespass me from my alma mater, each shot down in turn by me. He finally 
settled on that I could call the chief to which I responded that he was already their agent and had 
extended himself into making false allegations so why were we stopping there?
My number is 850-819-8817.

Thank you in advance.
Lance
