Good morning Mr. Mason,

Please send me any information you think would be helpful for your case and I can have my investigator 
reach out to them. 

Additionally, the Judge has special set a hearing for us on December 8 at 9am regarding the alleged 
violation of pretrial release. Please be sure to be available at that time and once I have the Zoom 
information I will send it to you. Just a reminder to not discuss the facts of your case and remember that 
everything you say will be on the record. As far as any emails or whatnot, please do not respond to any 
even if they are the mass emails sent from FSU. 

If you have any further questions, please let me know.


Thanks,
Lauren Brooker
