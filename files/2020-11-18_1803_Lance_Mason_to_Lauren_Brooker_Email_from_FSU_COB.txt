Lauren

have you gotten any Discovery back? 
I'd like to respond to this email but I am prevented. it seems an unusual requirement that I not be able 
to speak with the administration who is the principal to these guys agent and I'll bet you is not aware. is 
that not a form of violating my right of redress? this is not a private institution but a publicly funded 
University of which I am an alumnus. am I supposed to suspend all academic activity while they sort out 
a case that they can't produce Discovery for? why am I bound to their requirements while they are not 
bound to produce evidence?
