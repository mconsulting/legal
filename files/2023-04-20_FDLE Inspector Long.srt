robbery it's going to be related to t

116
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,530
heft of intellectual property, which I

117
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,250
can also prove we can just call over at

118
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,290

119
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,250

120
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,190
can we can test it out real quick and

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,090
it's it's billions of dollars. What I'm

122
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,620
talking about the the strong armed

123
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,410
robbery. It's on a recording. It's

124
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,250
related also at the theft of my

125
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,810
car and all kinds of

126
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,250
official misconduct and organized scheme

127
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,790
to defraud right there in Tallahassee.

128
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,390
At Florida State. See, I went to Florida

129
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,710
State. I'm a CPA, went to with the school

130
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,170
there. But we can get all into that and

131
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,800
I've got evidence just to back it up and

132
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,400
everything that we're saying here is

133
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,820
recorded and.

134
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,500
Having to do this to,

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,890
to flush it through, I mean we'll see.

136
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,250
You'll see that there should be a

137
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,190
complaint against Alonzo Green right now.

138
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,890
I mean there's like he's he was worried I

139
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,670
got him on a recording that's gonna be

140
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,950
that's gonna be Exhibit A because I've

141
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,730
said this stuff before to him

142
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,430
and he didn't want to hear it, but I've

143
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,280
got the recording and y'all can hear it.

144
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,060
So this, this is going to need to get

145
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,790
escalated up, I'm certain of it.

146
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,490
If I could get an e-mail where

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
you know not the general comments

148
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,790
 e-mail but the specific

149
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,670
person so that there can be a chain of

150
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,530
custody on this because he he

151
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,410
was sent out there to to bury

152
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,130
the case to not do anything and that's

153
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,370
what that's why the that's the nature of

154
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,350
why I picked 5 on the dial right there to

155
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,170
go to internal. This should be an

156
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,810
internal affairs and higher than the

157
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,280
issue go up to the governor's office. But

158
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,020
you'll see all that as I present the

159
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,610
evidence.

160
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,280
OK, First things first.

161
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,070
I do not give permission to be recorded.

162
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,590
So if you are recording me, I do request

163
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,740
that you stop recording me. I don't give

164
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,020
permission or consent for you to record

165
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,100
me. Fair enough, I can do that.

166
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,990
OK. And also and now

167
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,870
we do have a e-mail address that we

168
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,350

169
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,730
