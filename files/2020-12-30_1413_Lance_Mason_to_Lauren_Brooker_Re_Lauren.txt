no that is not okay. it is me whose civil rights have been violated and are being violated every time I 
have to report while they cannot produce the discovery. they were able to email within an hour on the 
partial video but here I am asking you for the fifth time probably if you've seen or have the video.

I'd like to get what all has been done on my case. I still have not seen the body cam video though I've 
asked for it since the beginning. I'm thinking that I can take the case and put more hours into it since 
it's pretty complex. I just need help on the procedure
