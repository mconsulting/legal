2020-11-02 FSUPD, Sergeant Collier official misconduct


  
[a]




00:00:05 Collier
Let's see.
00:00:08 Mason
Hey sorry hey I'm recording the call also.
00:00:12 Mason
OK, appreciate it.
00:00:14 Mason
Alright, thank you Sir.
00:00:15 Mason
Thank you for calling.
00:00:17 Collier
What's up?
00:00:19 Mason
Ah well.
00:00:21 Mason
I'm trying to run.
00:00:24 Mason
Then from the beginning, or with where we are and I'm looking for.
00:00:27 Collier
I mean, I've read them.
00:00:28 Collier
I've read the report.
00:00:29 Collier
What is it that you need?
00:00:30 Mason
I'd like to report the car stolen.
00:00:33 Mason
Then y'all can call the welcome call because y'all took it from me.
00:00:37 Mason
I mean, I believe that bills are 4th Amendment violations
00:00:39 Mason
OK, yes Sir.
00:00:42 Collier
You cannot report the car stolen.
If you want to try and continue to report the car stolen, you'll be filing false police report
00:00:50 Mason
Well, hold on well hold on.
00:00:52 Collier
Moving on.
00:00:54 Mason
But you refused to look at the title that I was offering to show to you, and y'all refused to see it.
00:00:59 Mason
And I was, I hadn't been to the DMV yet and y’all wouldn't look at the title.
Did did you listen to that part of the recording?
Did you listen to the body Cam video?
00:01:15 Collier
Not in the car.
00:01:16 Collier
The car is registered to Patricia Futrell.
00:01:22 Mason
That is correct, that is correct, but I had the title.
00:01:26 Mason
Well, that doesn't.
00:01:27 Mason
That does what if you get a title.
00:01:29 Mason
I do have the title.
00:01:33 Collier
What you have now is a simple situation.
00:01:37 Mason
Well, well.
OK, but what if we have?
We have an unreasonable seizure.
Also, that was a violation of the 4th Amendment.
00:01:47 Mason
I believe 'cause if you can't tell me the reason that I was that it was taken from me –  'cause they were going to release it to me–you should listen to the body Cam video.
and the car was seized from me without a charge.
I was standing right there offering to show you the title, but y'all refused to look at it.
Y'all wouldn't look at the title when I offered it so.


Otherwise you.
The vehicle was taken. at the request of the lawful owner
00:02:19 Mason
Nobody, she's not, she's not.
00:02:23 Mason
OK.
00:02:25 Mason
This is all going to be on YouTube, by the way.
00:02:28 Mason
OK.
00:02:29 Collier
The vehicle was towed.
00:02:32 Collier
The beat.
00:02:36 Mason
I had the title in the car.
00:02:38 Mason
I failed to do was to provide it to you.
00:02:41 Collier
Vehicle may change ownership.
00:02:46 Mason
Right, but what?
00:02:47 Mason
What if I what what about if I hadn't been?
00:02:50
No so.
00:02:51 Mason
If you'd leave like you pull off.
00:02:53 Mason
The yes OK.
00:02:56 Collier
So what you're saying is.
00:02:56 Mason
Not there.
00:03:00 Collier
There is a title in the car.
00:03:04 Collier
I don't know.
00:03:05 Collier
You're saying that you can take that title.
00:03:08 Collier
You can fill it out and.
00:03:11 Collier
Their name?
00:03:14 Mason
No, that's not.
00:03:14 Mason
True only only.
00:03:16 Mason
Well, that that that's an area that's true.
00:03:18 Mason
Well, that's true.
00:03:19 Mason
If it was a forged title, well, that would be true.
00:03:23 Mason
That would be true if it was.
00:03:24 Mason
If that was the case, but if I had the lawful owner which was my mother and had heard valid signature on.
00:03:31 Mason
A title with her instructing me multiple over a long time or mother says.
00:03:38 Collier
She's liable, she isn't.
00:03:40 Collier
She is liable for the.
00:03:42 Mason
Oh well, I mean, are you a lawyer?
00:03:45 Mason
And then because we're just, this is what I'm suggesting.
00:03:49 Mason
I mean, 'cause we're going to get into.
00:03:51 Mason
OK.
00:03:53 Collier
You feel that that is the case.
00:03:56 Collier
You go and you hire a lawyer, right?
00:04:01 Mason
No, I know no.
00:04:02 Mason
I I know she.
00:04:03 Mason
That's an unreasonable.
00:04:06 Mason
This is fun.
00:04:06 Collier
Like you know what you know, what you know, what you didn't.
00:04:08 Collier
Do you didn't file the title?
00:04:10 Mason
I didn't have time.
00:04:13 Mason
What I mean like if I pull off if I pull off the lot, I mean can they call the police?
00:04:19 Mason
Stop talking.
00:04:21 Collier
She said it's been months you had the car.
00:04:27 Speaker 1
Did you get my side of the story?.
00:04:30 Collier
Still, all she has to do, she can request a new title.
00:04:34 Collier
For the car.
00:04:36 Collier
And she can sell it.
00:04:37 Collier
She can do whatever.
00:04:39 Mason
OK.
00:04:39 Collier
She's the legal owner of the second because you did not complete the process and the steps that you needed.[b]
00:04:48 Mason
Fair enough, but I would like for that's fair enough.
00:04:51 Mason
OK, I'm I'm I'm not, I'm just I'm tabling that.
00:04:55 Collier
What you need to do?
00:05:00 Mason
Right?
00:05:01 Collier
Go hire an attorney
00:05:04 Mason
What about?
00:05:11 Mason
OK, so let's put that aside.
00:05:15 Mason
OK, that's assuming that you aren't on the hook
We towed the car on the
All legal owners.
00:05:27 Mason
Can we get that bodycam
See we're missing about 17 minutes of body Cam video and we're missing the entire–
Let's just move past that
OK, we'll table that subject.
Let's move to the missing body Cam video.
00:05:44 Collier
I'm not sure if I'm not, I don't know.
00:05:47 Mason
OK.
00:05:49 Mason
Well, I've already done a discovery request and they have they didn't they?
00:05:55 Mason
There's no scope limitation on what they return to.
00:05:58 Mason
They gave me partial, they give me some of the video, but there was 17 minutes missing on the 1st incident.
00:06:04 Mason
But I have the recording.  
We can listen to my recording and that's nowhere found
And then also we have the entire arrest is not there.
00:06:15 Mason
I was not arrested?
00:06:17 Mason
That's news to me.
00:06:17 Mason
'cause they didn't.
00:06:18 Mason
'cause they took me to the Leon County Jail.
00:06:21 Mason
I mean, I didn't just walk in there.
00:06:24 Mason
I'm sorry I stayed in Leon County Jail and well, well, I mean it seemed like I was arrested.
00:06:37 Mason
A friendly business with the Florida State Police.
00:06:43 Mason
Well that’s a material detail.
00:06:46
This is it.
00:06:48 Collier
Is this another?
00:06:49 Mason
Day, no, that's the same after this.
00:06:51 Mason
This is the same afternoon.
00:06:54 Mason
Like I have had a knife pulled on me when I see my mom went out.
00:06:58 Collier
He did.
00:07:01 Mason
Yeah, I.
00:07:03 Mason
He said if.
00:07:04 Mason
You didn't know all versions you have, you don't.
00:07:06 Mason
Know nothing yet.
00:07:07 Collier
OK, you were arrested.
00:07:10 Mason
The next day, no.
00:07:12 Mason
The night.
00:07:13 Mason
The same night it was.
00:07:14 Mason
It was about 9:00 o'clock that evening.
00:07:20 Collier
You're arrested on the 10th for trespass after warning by totally different officer.
00:07:27 Mason
Well, I didn't suggest that it was the same officer.
00:07:29 Collier
OK.


That video is missing.
00:07:44 Speaker 5
Let's see.
00:07:49 Collier
OK, so your car was towed on the ninth.
00:07:51 Collier
OK, which is the previous day.
00:07:53 Collier
You were arrested.
00:07:55 Mason
Well, that was only 'cause they booked me after midnight, possibly because I was.
00:08:00 Collier
Which is the exact definition of.
00:08:02 Collier
Correct, well, I mean.
00:08:04 Mason
If we're talking about the same calendar date.
00:08:06 Collier
It was about.
00:08:09 Mason
Well, let's get into some.
I love that.


I’m a technician in that stuff.
00:08:15 Mason
So you're saying that I was arrested after midnight.
00:08:19 Mason
And that technically would.
00:08:21 Mason
Well, it was the same.
00:08:23 Mason
Day that I got the I got this trespass order.
00:08:26 Mason
Maybe y'all didn't get it into.
00:08:29 Collier
Now they gave you the trespass warning that.
00:08:32 Collier
On the 9th.
00:08:34 Mason
Well, we would be able to uncover that if we had the video now, wouldn't we?
00:08:42 Mason
Now we can just.
00:08:42 Mason
I mean we're not doing so good on record keeping.
00:08:45 Mason
So far we don't know where my car.
00:08:46 Mason
We don't know where my phone or my.
00:08:48 Collier
Actually, so you were actually.
The officer actually encountered you on the 9th
00:08:54 Mason
Oh, really, yeah, that's what I was just saying.
00:08:56 Mason
You were just lecturing me on my technical, technical technicality.
00:09:02 Mason
I just thought you were lecturing me on that.
00:09:04 Mason
And showing, oh that's because I was correct in the beginning and you were incorrect as I mean, if we're just getting technical on that, that's why that happened.
00:09:14 Collier
Some reason I don't know why they take.
00:09:15 Mason
Yes wow right?
00:09:18 Mason
OK, well I'm just going on what I said OK?
Collier
It’s inconsequential
No, but but you had made a point of it, so I was just bringing that to your attention.
00:09:30 Collier
Well, again.
00:09:33 Mason
OK.
00:09:35 Collier
The vehicle was towed by the lawful owner, yes.
00:09:39 Mason
OK, I will leave.
00:09:39 Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
00:09:44 Mason
What about my belongings my?
00:09:45 Mason
But she doesn't have title to my shotgun either.
00:09:48 Mason
She doesn't have title to any of my belongings, but yet there it was.
00:09:52 Mason
She's got him so I get to.
00:09:55 Mason
Oh yeah, my computer and my phone are still with the FSU police.
00:09:59 Mason
Or are they not?
00:10:01 Mason
Yeah, we don't know because when I.
00:10:02 Mason
Called last week they were.
00:10:04 Mason
They said it wasn't there, you know?
00:10:06 Mason
So I'm trying to figure that.
00:10:08 Mason
Seems like a damn unreasonable search and seizure to me.
00:10:11 Mason
I mean, I'm just guessing at that, but I would like to talk to the.
00:10:16 Collier
Broken engine.
00:10:17 Mason
I'm sorry no, no no.
00:10:19 Mason
The the part, the window.
00:10:23 Mason
So that gives you the if that does that constitute probable cost?
00:10:27 Mason
I mean to to like you that just gives you free license.
00:10:31 Mason
I mean, you don't even need anything then.
00:10:33 Mason
Uh, like I'm allowed to like.
00:10:36 Mason
Without a charge to.
00:10:37 Mason
Like and I come up while they're there and identified myself and you can hear them talking to my parents.
00:10:43 Mason
So it would seem to be like I'd like to know if the administration.
00:10:47 Collier
Are you still?
00:10:48 Collier
What are you still I still.
00:10:50 Speaker 6
I said
00:10:52 Collier
It's not the.
00:10:53 Collier
Best morning.
00:10:56 Mason
Is that relevant or is that is?
00:10:58 Mason
Is that the question?
00:11:00 Mason
Uh, I'm, let's see I don't know yeah, OK, no I'm you arrested.
00:11:08 Mason
Is that relevant?
00:11:10 Mason
Is that relevant?
00:11:12 Mason
Is that relevant?
00:11:13 Mason
I don't know.
00:11:15 Mason
If I do, I have a conviction.
00:11:17 Mason
Do I have a conviction?
00:11:18 Mason
When's my last conviction?
00:11:30 Mason
Convicted never.
00:11:36 Mason
That is correct.
00:11:38 Mason
Well, I mean would not have a gun charge if I did because y'all had my shotgun right there.
00:11:43 Mason
If I had a felony.
00:11:45 Collier
Apparently, you said.
00:11:49 Mason
That is such a word.
00:11:51 Mason
Where's that?
00:11:51 Mason
Because I've.
00:11:52 Mason
Always said that was my shotgun I'd like.
00:11:54 Mason
To see where you where, did you find that?
00:11:58 Mason
Because that's a false piece of information.
00:12:01 Mason
That's a false statement.
00:12:02 Speaker 1
Right?
00:12:03 Mason
Who I didn't say that somebody else said that.
00:12:06 Mason
And whoever said that was making a false statement when they said it 'cause I would never say that 'cause it's all because I went to Walmart and bought it myself.
00:12:15 Mason
So yes, and would not be exposed for a felon in possession of a firearm if I had been since we're on the whole felon thing.
00:12:25 Mason
If I was a felon, wouldn't all of like what not be in jail?
00:12:32 Speaker 4
I've been close to being my phone a few times.
00:12:35 Mason
Yeah, yeah, I would think so too.
00:12:37 Mason
So that's why the information you've been given is incorrect.
00:12:42 Mason
I mean, and you were just making.
00:12:44 Mason
A big deal out about that like that was the turn like the whole.
00:12:47 Mason
Case turned on that.
00:12:50 Mason
And I'm just saying, well, why wouldn't y'all?
00:12:52 Mason
Why didn't you make a big deal about it while I was still there?
00:13:00
I mean these are.
00:13:01 Mason
Silly, I mean, yeah, we'll put this out there.
00:13:08 Mason
I would like to.
00:13:09 Mason
Know who says it?
00:13:10 Mason
That was not my shotgun.
00:13:14 Mason
Well, I mean, maybe it's.
00:13:15 Mason
On the video that's missing.
00:13:20 Speaker 4
Like it goes.
00:13:30 Mason
And I like and.
00:13:31 Mason
I mean, just while we're on it, I'd like the partner being a Business School and do I have permission to call the Dean because they want me to go to Graduate School there and I'm going to have to let them know that?
00:13:42 Mason
No, because I've got a trespass order that you may or may not be aware of.
00:13:47 Mason
Everybody Boo.
00:13:49 Speaker 5
Yeah, you have a transmission.
00:13:51 Mason
Right, and like I don't see why why they're still recruiting me to go to Graduate School there like that's going to be.
00:13:59 Mason
It's going to be tricky taking classes there.
00:14:03 Mason
You know you're always trying to get me to donate stuff.
00:14:06 Collier
But once you become.
00:14:08 Mason
Right, but I see yeah yeah, yeah but yeah.
00:14:13 Mason
Let's see.
00:14:16 Mason
We I got a no contact.
00:14:17 Collier
Never mind, you're correct.
00:14:20 Collier
Your mom said she did not know.
00:14:23 Mason
Right he see.
00:14:26 Mason
Well now you just go out there and like, accuse me of making a false statement and making sure I'm on the record and all that and then it turns out that you were incorrect.
00:14:35 Mason
But we've got two times without first of all.
00:14:37 Mason
First of all, I mean, you did your honor roll.
00:14:40 Mason
You got two of them the first time you were making a big deal, whether it's.
00:14:43 Mason
The 9th or the 10th and then.
00:14:46 Mason
Come to find out, I was writing it on that one too, so I mean I'm on a roll.
00:14:51 Mason
OK, so I mean, did you you said something about a felony?
00:14:55 Speaker 4
I mean what?
00:14:56 Mason
Are we going for a trifecta?
00:14:57 Mason
You said this felony I'm I'm saying I didn't with is that not three is that three in one phone call?
00:15:08 Mason
Yes, yes.
00:15:12 Mason
OK, I'll table that I'm talking about now I'm talking about the 4th Amendment violation, but on the ledging.
00:15:19 Mason
Oh, so you've just deemed that.
00:15:22 Mason
I mean like you just decided the case yourself.
00:15:26 Mason
It was not abandoned.
00:15:27 Mason
I was standing there.
00:15:28 Mason
I was standing there.
00:15:31 Mason
OK, well when I walked up it was not abandoned.
00:15:34 Mason
Anyone well after?
00:15:38 Collier
Try turning the owner.
00:15:39 Speaker 4
Me too.
00:15:42 Mason
Yes, yeah, have you?
00:15:50 Speaker 4
Right?
00:15:54 Mason
OK, obviously you're straining.
00:15:54 Speaker 4
Second, yeah.
00:16:02 Mason
That's we weren't.
00:16:03 Mason
We had already moved to the part about where I was given a trespass order and you were alleging that maybe it was because of my felony that I don't have.
00:16:18 Mason
Yeah, yeah, that's true, right?
00:16:24 Mason
Yeah, so really like coming.
00:16:27 Collier
45
00:16:28 Mason
Right, right, right.
00:16:30 Mason
Right, right?
00:16:31 Mason
Or yeah, so I'm trying to figure out now why I was giving a trespass order.
00:16:41 Collier
Fashion cupcakes
00:16:42 Speaker 1
I think.
00:16:44 Mason
Well, I mean, I mean, I mean, you're out here, you're making you or an agent.
00:16:49 Mason
So you are representing.
00:16:51 Mason
You're representing them already while we stopping right here.
00:16:54 Mason
I mean, you have extended yourself out and she's making a couple of youth that there were false allegations for or somebody else.
00:17:03 Mason
Made a false statement or you misunderstood whatever.
00:17:06 Mason
No, no listen.
00:17:09 Mason
No, you have wasted a lot.
00:17:10 Mason
Hey, can I find out where my property is?
00:17:14 Mason
Can I find out where my put my?
00:17:17 Mason
My phone or my computer?
00:17:21 Mason
Do we know if that's there?
00:17:28 Mason
Now this is where the night the 9th.
00:17:32 Mason
The same day.
00:17:34 Collier
When you write.
00:17:35 Mason
That is correct.
00:17:40 Speaker 4
Oh, you have here?
00:17:59 Mason
And does the administration know that I've been trespassed?
00:18:04 Mason
Start talking now like I want to.
00:18:06 Mason
Talk to the Dean of the Business School.
00:18:07 Speaker 4
All that.
00:18:09 Collier
No, we don't.
00:18:10 Collier
We don't don't have to.
00:18:12 Mason
Go and I'll just hand out the sentence right there.
00:18:15 Mason
So you don't know why I was stressed out.
00:18:19 Mason
Right, that's enough, right?
00:18:21 Speaker 6
That's why you smell like grease last night.
00:18:23 Speaker 6
Well, I can't wonder why I smell like ******* Greeks.
00:18:30 Speaker 6
Well, let's see what that means, right?
00:18:34 Mason
Yes, so we don't.
00:18:35 Mason
Well, unless you do.
00:18:37 Speaker 4
That and then.
00:18:40 Mason
But I wanna find out why I was doing it.
00:18:43 Speaker 4
Backpack is outdated stuff on all of that.
00:18:46 Collier
Find out why.
00:18:55 Mason
What about my computer and telephone?
00:19:00 Speaker 4
She followed up with.
00:19:08 Mason
I guess his name was.
00:19:10 Mason
He's the guy from last week with you.
00:19:16 Mason
Oh I forgot.
00:19:17 Speaker 1
The heat.
00:19:19 Speaker 1
Why's that?
00:19:21 Mason
Hey, we're gonna wear I mean.
00:19:22 Mason
But then again, like they they separate these cases like the beginning of the body Cam for the first video or for the 1st.
00:19:30 Mason
Incident within not the second.
00:19:33 Mason
Was that by the way, like I requested?
00:19:36 Mason
I mean, I was explicit.
00:19:39 Mason
The empires of Discovery request I want everything.
00:19:43 Collier
Which which.
00:19:49 Mason
The second one.
00:19:53 Speaker 5
Almost every fall.
00:20:02 Speaker 5
2nd, it's a discovery request.
00:20:11 Mason
What if it does?
00:20:16 Mason
Oh well, what if I'm acting per say?
00:20:17 Mason
At this point I was like I'm given I was.
00:20:24 Mason
I did.
00:20:25 Mason
I did well not to the I.
00:20:27 Mason
There was two the.
00:20:29 Mason
And but I was there was no scope limitation on what they provided back.
00:20:33 Mason
I was very explicit in what I asked.
00:20:36 Speaker 5
That plane leadership.
00:20:39 Mason
OK.
00:20:43 Mason
OK, but the other one gave me that part of it.
00:20:50 Speaker 4
Second timer.
00:20:59 Mason
Yeah, well, I I did what I did.
00:21:02 Mason
I think I.
00:21:03 Mason
Think it's going to be a loser case because I was.
00:21:05 Mason
You'll see in that video like the best excuse for the drugs would throw it out, but this is not really.
00:21:11 Mason
That's interesting there.
00:21:12 Mason
Yeah, but why was I given part of that video?
00:21:18 Mason
Yeah, but we don't know.
00:21:19 Mason
OK, let's go, let's get back to why was I giving the trespass order there?
00:21:24 Speaker 4
Do we know that?
00:21:31 Mason
Yeah, it's kind of.
00:21:32 Mason
I mean, that seems kind of nebulous, doesn't it?
00:21:36 Mason
And it coincides with 17 minutes of the video was missing.
00:21:39 Mason
'cause I've come back and I'm recording when I come back and nowhere that that video is nowhere.
00:21:46 Mason
And how we deliberated and arrived at the decision to take myself, right for at least arbitrary?
00:21:53 Mason
Heh heh.
00:21:55 Speaker 4
Yeah, OK.
00:21:58 Collier
You want your backpack computer back, it was taken.
00:22:05 Mason
OK.
00:22:11 Mason
OK.
00:22:16 Collier

00:22:18 Speaker 4

00:22:25 Collier
As far as the other.
00:22:30 Collier
On the bar.
00:22:33 Mason
Yeah yeah, yeah.
00:22:35 Mason
You don't think there's any 4th Amendment violation?
00:22:38 Mason
You don't think that there's an unreasonable search and seizure?
00:22:42 Speaker 4
No, I do not.
00:22:44 Speaker 4
You do not, OK.
00:22:46 Mason
OK, but what but what about this seizure?
00:22:51 Mason
