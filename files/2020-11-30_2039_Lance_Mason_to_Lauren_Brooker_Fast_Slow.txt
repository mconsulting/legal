this is just a first preliminary email but can I infer from your email that we have not gotten back 
discovery? it seems unjust that my rights have been diminished, having to account for pretrial 
release while the prosecution cannot produce the discovery. are they not under some duty to 
produce at our repeated demand before I am brought before a judge on the process? isn't it 
more serious that they can't produce the evidence against me? isn't that putting the cart before 
the horse? how is it that one is on The fast track and one is on a slow boat to China? isn't it 
noteworthy that they were able to produce, with Dropbox links within the hour for selected body 
cam video and no scope limitation, and 50 days and counting to produce the remainder? I 
assume you heard the interview with me and the sergeant. there are so many holes in the story 
between the police and my parents that it'll take another email and a while to compile them. I'll 
tell you something that jumped off the page at me on the police report is that my mother has 
already admitted and the police have understood that the car was given to me as a gift. do they 
not know the rules on that and that they contradict the very foundation of their principal 
argument?
I'll write more and you will have a list of people and the reasons they will have information

Good morning Mr. Mason, 

Please send me any information you think would be helpful for your case and I can have my investigator 
reach out to them. 

Additionally, the Judge has special set a hearing for us on December 8 at 9am regarding the alleged 
violation of pretrial release. Please be sure to be available at that time and once I have the Zoom 
information I will send it to you. Just a reminder to not discuss the facts of your case and remember that 
everything you say will be on the record. As far as any emails or whatnot, please do not respond to any 
even if they are the mass emails sent from FSU. 

If you have any further questions, please let me know.


Thanks,
Lauren Brooker
