Pat,

I have no way to call my pre-trial since I have no minutes. Since I cannot easily contact the FBI without a 
phone, can I get some minutes and I’ll pay you back?

Since you orchestrated the FSU incident and won’t now provide a written statement about it, I was 
thinking maybe you could make it easier to contact (PREtrial, attorney, FBI) that are a result of your 
coordinated efforts with the FSU PD.



Withdrawing from a conspiracy

https://www.fletc.gov/audio/federal-conspiracy-law-mp3

Just as the law recognizes that a person can join an on-going conspiracy, the law also 
recognizes that an individual may withdraw from a Conspiracy prior to its completion. 
Withdrawal from a Conspiracy requires more than simply no longer participating. To withdraw 
from a Conspiracy, there are two basic requirements: First – the person must do some 
affirmative act inconsistent with the goals of the Conspiracy. Unless the co-conspirator can 
demonstrate that he quit the Conspiracy, his or her participation in the Conspiracy is presumed 
to continue. Second – the co-conspirator must do some affirmative act that is reasonably 
calculated to communicate to a fellow co-conspirator, or law enforcement, that he has 
withdrawn from the Conspiracy. Withdrawal from a Conspiracy is an affirmative defense that 
must be raised and proven by the defendant


I don’t know if that’s enough of an argument for you to make, but it is a start. 
Thanks in advance.


Lauren,

Please contact my pre trial and let them know. I’ll try to have minutes by the end of the day.
