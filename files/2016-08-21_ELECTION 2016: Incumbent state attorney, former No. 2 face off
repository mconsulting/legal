Incumbent State Attorney Glenn Hess, left, is being challenged by former chief assistant state attorney Greg Wilson.
PANAMA CITY — In the race for the circuit’s top prosecutor, voters will have to choose between an incumbent and his former second-in-command — both of whom claim credit for the historic success of the office. 

The race for the 14th Judicial Circuit State Attorney Office (SAO) started in May, when former deputy chief Greg Wilson abruptly resigned from the office, claiming State Attorney Glenn Hess did not fulfill an agreement to bow out after his current term ends. Since then, the race has turned personal, with Wilson going on the attack as Hess touts his career in public service. However, both candidates agree the SAO is winning trials at an unprecedented rate, and both have been attempting to distinguish their roles in attaining the feat. 

Hess said before he was elected to the office in 2008, the SAO was winning only about 52 percent of trials. It didn’t deter defendants from taking a case to trial, and ended up costing more in the long run to expend the man-power investigating the cases and then prosecuting, he said. 

That figure now is at about 82 percent, including a streak of winning murder trials during his administration, Hess said. At the same time, the number of cases making it to trial without a plea agreement has dropped. 

“You have people offering a plea deal directly to the judge now,” Hess said. “They don’t want to take the chance against our attorneys.” 

He attributed the success to decisions under his leadership to hire and retain trial-winning attorneys and implement a “team research” approach to trial prosecution. 

Wilson agreed the SAO has done better under Hess than under previous administrations. However, he attributed the success to his own hiring decisions. He argued that for a large part of Hess’ administration, he actually has been the one at the helm. 

To illustrate his point, Wilson published a graph in an advertisement that showed a steady incline of trials won since he was hired as deputy chief. Adjacent to the graph were figures that show Hess taking 153 days out of office since 2013, including 62 vacation days. Wilson argued that Hess has not been engaged while the office continued to excel. 

“That’s the difference,” Wilson said. “With him, you get the same-old-same-old. With me you’ll have progress.” 

The attacks leveled by Wilson during the campaign have ranged from claims of Hess’ handing out “political favors” for people who contributed to his previous campaigns to Hess being anti-Second Amendment for his role in defeating a bill that would have shifted the burden of in “Stand Your Ground” cases onto the prosecution. 

Wilson also claimed Hess decided to run for another term to receive about $100,000 in additional retirement funds before stepping down a year into the upcoming term. 

Hess responded to each of the claims in an interview with The News Herald. He denied the hiring of a former campaign fundraiser was motivated by cronyism but rather was out of necessity. He also said the Stand Your Ground bill would have upended the legal precedent in self-defense cases. Hess added that, despite the office usually attracting personal attacks during campaign season, the allegation that he was running for another to get the money and retire was a deeper, more personal attack than in previous races. 

Hess said retirement funds would be used to support his children, including his son, who lost his leg to an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. 

Wilson and Hess both are running on the Republican ticket for the circuit, which covers Bay, Calhoun, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson and Washington counties.
