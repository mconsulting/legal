Good morning Mr. Mason,

I’m not sure if you’ve received my voicemail or not. I am excusing you from court next week and will be 
continuing your case. But I would like for us to schedule a phone appointment before your next court 
date. Please let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,
Lauren Brooker

lauren,

have you seen the video? I've sent a Google doc to you and at the bottom there's a list of 12 or 13 
things that they just left off of their narrative.
I'd like to get them on the hook right now about that.
I also like to get an acknowledgment that the administration is even aware of this. I'm in alumnus and 
this certainly wasn't in the recruiting literature. I can establish a direct link between my professor and 
her son who I've got on the hook for fraud hands down. there's some reasonable doubt I would think 
and you don't even know the half yet.
I've been reluctant to put that out there because I don't think that they really know anything about all 
this. if they do and are okay with it it'll be out there on display very quickly as it is great evidence in 
both cases civil and criminal. 
can you just send me a copy of the videos also
