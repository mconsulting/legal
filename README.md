## Walsh/Futrell give less than their best performances after a strong armed robbery attempt.

## Calls to State Attorney, and answers to legal questions
Kim 8/9 - Even if notified in advance that the call is being recorded, it is "Highly illegal" when dealing with them since they are "public" (and are paid by the taxpayers if they are elected by the people).  Though the citizens are recorded without notification at every police station and most likely even at the 14th Judicial Circuit SAO, the employees working for the elected official carve out an extra amount of privacy for themselves personally, though they presumably knew they would likely be rendering advice to the public over the telephone about important legal matters forced upon them.
Across the border in Alabama or Georgia, or in 37 other one party consent states and the  Federal Court system, it is apparently OK, but in this state and only 10 more, it is highly illegal.
I had read those because they have been of particular interest to me and I did not remember the carve out for employees at the elected State Attorney in the capacity disseminating information to the publi.

I have observed over my career that an individual's anxiety level about being recorded giving advice is inversely proportional to the quality of that advice.  People don't wrestle the phone out of your hand if they get recorded saying "Don't drink and drive".

The question about filing felony charges without the blessing of a policeman--who in all likelihood will not ALSO be experienced in forensic auditing and complex financial transactions, has had some light shed on the subject.  You still have to get the police man to call back to the same office.   It is still a formality everyone has to do just because they said so like a mandatory mask mandate even if you have been triple vaxed and are driving alone in your car.  A victim must still check those extra boxes that the abuser did not, and will be given a third and fourth mulligan, perjury charges be damned. go through the effort of teaching him the absolute basics, followed by a deep dive into a real world maze of transactions created  of a phalanx of experts who specialize in concealment strategies for the discriminating oil and gas fraudster.
