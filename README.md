- Listened to recording of Pat and Harry Futrell, added a few captions and put it together with the actual event.  Got utterly discouraged listening to my mother sticking up for the people that have stolen everything from me including my grandmother.  She continues to do her best and has a stalking charge against me, but that I am doing some quality control on as well.  The SAO should consider the truthfulness of the witnesses here, but I have more.
- I have plenty of evidence to get an investigation going on theft of trade secrets, violations of the communications fraud act, evidence tampering, and official misconduct.  All state crimes, and all felonies I believe, so the same states attorneys can prosecute when they see felonies, and should be obliged to i believe.  If not, then the voters and the public should see that as well.
