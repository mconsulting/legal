# Mason Prepaid Legal

## Walsh/Futrell give less than their best performances after a strong armed robbery attempt.

## Calls to State Attorney, and answers to legal questions
Kim 8/9 - Even if notified in advance that the call is being recorded, it is "Highly illegal" when dealing with them since they are "public" (and are paid by the taxpayers if they are elected by the people).  Though the citizens are recorded without notification at every police station and most likely even at the 14th Judicial Circuit SAO, the employees working for the elected official carve out an extra amount of privacy for themselves personally, though they presumably knew they would likely be rendering advice to the public over the telephone regarding legal matters in which they are either prosecuting a defendant or assisting a victim.
Across the border in Alabama or Georgia, or in 37 more states and the entire Federal Court system allows one person to record a call in which they are participating.  

I have observed over my career that the anxiety about being recorded giving advice is inversely proportional to the quality of that advice.  People don't wrestle the phone out of your hand if they get recorded saying "Don't drink and drive".

Melissa 8/10

The question about filing felony charges without the blessing of a policeman who in all likelihood will not ALSO be experienced in forensic auditing and complex financial transactions intended to obscure the identities of shadowy investors, was answered.  You still have to get the police man to call back to the same office after teaching him the absolute basics, straight to real world complex, to saying it the right way to the state attorney who can then talk to me after a full day.
