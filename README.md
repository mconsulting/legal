Texas congressman responsible for stinger missile whose introduction marked the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union occupation of Afghanistan.  A single person having less than a days trainings could bring down the aircraft of a world super power.

In the modern era, in the Ukraine,the [javelin missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin) is serving the same role as a force multiplier.  Once again it has the leaders in the Kremlin considering all options with a resistance much more dangerous than anticipated.

### June 29
- Listened to recording of Pat and Harry Futrell, added a few captions and put it together with the actual event.  Got utterly discouraged listening to my mother sticking up for the people that have stolen everything from me including my grandmother.  She continues to do her best and has a stalking charge against me, but that I am doing some quality control on as well.  The SAO should consider the truthfulness of the witnesses here, but I have more.
-  to get an investigation going on theft of trade secrets, violations of the communications fraud act, evidence tampering, and official misconduct.  All state crimes, and all felonies. so the same states attorneys can prosecute when they see felonies, and should be obliged to i believe.  If not, then the voters and the public should see that as well.

- FSU unable to produce audit logs for the bodycam.  I have asked three months ago on April 8, and multiple times since.
- disclosed at 500 days that bodycam requested continuously was deleted.
- Angela Senich refuses to even ask for the audit log.
