## Calls to State Attorney, and answers to legal questions
Kim 8/9 - Even if notified in advance that the call is being recorded, it is "Highly illegal" when dealing with the State Attorney's office since they are "public" (and are paid by the taxpayers if they are elected by the people).  Though the citizens are recorded without notification at every police station and most likely even at the 14th Judicial Circuit SAO, the employees working for the elected official carve out an extra amount of privacy for themselves personally, though they presumably knew it would be possible they would be rendering advice to the public over the telephone about important legal matters to average citizens.
Across the border in Alabama or Georgia, or in 37 other one party consent states and the  Federal Court system, it is apparently OK, but in this state and only 10 more, it is "highly illegal", though the citation is still needed.
I had read those because they have been of particular interest to me and I did not remember the carve out for employees at the elected State Attorney acting within the scope of their employment.

I have observed over my career that an individual's anxiety level about being recorded giving advice, is inversely proportional to the quality of that advice.  People don't wrestle the phone out of your hand if they get recorded saying "Don't drink and drive".

The question about filing felony charges without the blessing of a policeman--who in all likelihood will not ALSO be experienced in forensic auditing and complex financial transactions, has had some light shed on the subject.  You still have to get the police man to call.
